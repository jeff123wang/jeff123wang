- ðŸ‘€ My first encounter with coding was purely accidental. My colleague got a request to rename thousands of files to different formats. I still remember how frustrated she was when her manager made this request. I decided to make an Excel macro to automate this process. Not only to help my colleague but her boss as well. Looking back, the code at the time was kind of ugly, no comment, no indentation, but it really saved someone's day. This experience will forever remain in my memory, and I believe that coding can make the world a better place.
